This is our review for the fourth part of the Reversi assignment series where we were given code
by our providers, Troy Caron and Joshua Kung, and we were tasked with adapting our code to work with
their views and strategies for the game. This review will be broken down into the following two sections:

1. Experience with Providers
Working with the provider group was both insightful and challenging. The communication process was essential,
and timely responses were crucial for the success of the integration. Fortunately, my provider group was responsive,

such as a well-structured design and clear interfaces. However, there were areas that required improvement,
particularly in terms of documentation. Requesting changes from the provider group was a smooth process. Overall,
the experience with the provider group was a new experience and a great opportunity to work with others' code.


2. Overall Experience
Working with code that you haven't written was initially challenging, however,
